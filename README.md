Timer for the Adafruit [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333) (should work with Circuit Playground Express too, but not tested) with TFT Gizmo display.

For libraries referenced in the code see the [CircuitPython Displayio Quickstart](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tft-gizmo/circuitpython-displayio-quickstart). In addition to the libraries referenced in the source, the following libraries are needed to pretty much do anything:
- adafruit_st7789
- adafruit_gizmo

Follow the quick start instructions carefully.
